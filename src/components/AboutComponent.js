Artists can take the whole series, customized combinations, or individual workshops that best suit their needs, and the curriculum is available for people interested in leading the workshops and offering professional development resources.</p>

                        <p>The Work of Art series has been taught by Springboard for the Arts at arts organizations, libraries and colleges in over 80 communities in the Upper Midwest, and replicated across the country by artists, arts organizations, and colleges and universities. After teaching the workshops to thousands of artists, we decided that we could have our biggest impact by offering this resource as freely and widely as possible. The Work of Art Toolkit is available for free digitally, now with a 2020 update! The update includes:</p>
